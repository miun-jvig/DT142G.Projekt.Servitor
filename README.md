# -- DT142G.Projekt.Servitor --

A project done in the course "Applikationsutveckling i Java" in Mittuniversitetet, Sundsvall. The goal of the project is to create a functional Java-application for servers to use at a fictional restaurant.

**DATABASE**

The project uses a DB-connection to receive and send the following information:

- Receives and sends bookings for the six available tables
- Receives all items on the menu (Al Carte)
- Send orders to to the database

These orders are then opened on an application for the kitchen - https://github.com/miun-jvig/DT142G.Projekt.Kok.
